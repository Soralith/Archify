## Usage

### Download Music

* Run `./music-download.sh`.
* Enter a keyword for the music you want.
* Press `TAB` to select multiple songs, then `Enter` to download.
* Downloaded MP3 files with embedded cover images will be saved in `~/Music` by default.
* Press `q` and `Enter` to exit the script.

### Play / Toggle Music

* Run `./music-toggle.sh` to start or toggle music playback in `~/Music`.
* If `mpv` is already running, the script will stop it first and restart playback.
* Shuffle and infinite loop are enabled by default.
* Playback is audio-only (no video).

## Hyprland Integration (Optional)

If you use **Hyprland** as your window manager, you can create custom keybinds to control your music scripts without opening a terminal. Here’s an example setup:

```ini
bind = SUPER+Ctrl+Shift, Space, exec, $musicToggle
bind = SUPER+Shift, KP_Add, exec, echo 'playlist-next' | socat - /tmp/mpvsocket
bind = SUPER+Shift, KP_Subtract, exec, echo 'playlist-prev' | socat - /tmp/mpvsocket
bind = SUPER, N, exec, pkill -f "mpv.*Music"
bind = SUPER+Ctrl, M, exec, $musicDownload
```

* `$musicToggle` = path to `music-toggle.sh`, e.g.:

```bash
$musicToggle = ~/.config/hypr/scripts/Music/music-toggle.sh
```

* `$musicDownload` = path to `music-download.sh`, e.g.:

```bash
$musicDownload = ~/.config/hypr/scripts/Music/music-download.sh
```

* Make sure scripts are executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/.config/hypr/scripts/Music/music-toggle.sh
chmod +x ~/.config/hypr/scripts/Music/music-download.sh
```

Once set up, you can toggle music playback, skip tracks, stop the player, or launch the downloader directly from your keyboard, giving you **full control without leaving your workflow**.

> Tip: You can customize the keybinds to any combination that feels comfortable.

## Notes

* Make sure you have enough storage in `~/Music`.
* `yt-dlp` might fail if YouTube changes its API. Update regularly:

```bash
yt-dlp -U
```

* Covers are embedded automatically if available, but not all videos have thumbnails.
